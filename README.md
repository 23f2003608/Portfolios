## 🚀 Vision

Designing a portfolio from scratch takes **time, effort, and endless tweaking**.

**Portfolios** solves this by providing:

* 🎯 Beautiful ready-to-use designs
* 📦 Each portfolio in a **single file**
* ⚡ Just download → edit text & images → deploy
* 💡 Want Demonstration ? **[Click Here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ushReWJf9R4ErhQc8-T87MfSWk303zT/view?usp=sharing)**

No frameworks. No configs. No complexity.

> * I initially built and added **7 unique single-file portfolios** to kickstart this project. The vision is bigger than just templates..it’s about creating a **community-driven collection** of creative developer portfolios.
> * Now it’s your turn  
> * Let’s build the largest open-source single-file portfolio library together.
